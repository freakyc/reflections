What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is created.  This is where the files are hidden to track the
status of the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area are files that will be added to the repository but haven't
been committed yet.  It allows for files to be worked on before those changes
are committed.
