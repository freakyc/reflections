How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It allows you to only see what changed instead of going through the whole
file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could review changes in how you programmed certain things and got
better at doing certain things.  See how different problems were fixed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you get to decide when to save something that is worth saving and
you don't accidently delete something you want.
    Cons: you have to remember to commit a change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is concerned with a whole project where Google Docs you are only
editting one file at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows a history of all commits made and git diff shows the
differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You'd be more confident because you'd know you could always roll back to a
version prior to those changes being made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For all my digital files but most specifically any programming that I
start to do.
